#HINT: To find out how many players should be on each team, divide the length of players by the number of teams:

#display():
#"hen the menu or stats display to the console, 
#it should display in a nice readable format. Use extra spaces or line breaks('\n') 
# to break up lines if needed. For example, '\nThis will start on a newline.'


#the script should not crash due to  uncaught exception



# logic should be wrapped inside a Dunder Main statement for your script.



# Do not modify or mutate the imported data from constants.py in any way.

#HINT: You will want to iterate over this data and create a new data structure to hold your cleaned data.

# Assign players to each team so the teams are evenly balanced by total players.





#The order in which you assign the players do not matter but should be balanced when team assignment is finished.

#The same player cannot be assigned to multiple teams.

#As a user, I should be able to respond to a menu with each of the following options:

#    Display a given teams stats
#    Quit the program

#Actual names of the displayed options are up to you but must make sense.
